## Meslo Nerd Font

A gorgeous monospace font designed by Jim Lyles for Bitstream, customized for Apple, enhanced by Andr√© Berg, and finally patched by Roman Perepelitsa of Powerlevel10k with scripts originally developed by Ryan McIntyre of Nerd Fonts. Contains all the glyphs and symbols that Tide may need. Battle-tested in dozens of different terminals on all major operating systems.
