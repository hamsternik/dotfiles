<h1 align="center">~/.dotfiles üíª</h1>

Hi there üëã

The basic case ‚Äì your Macbook is new and so empty. And you need to settle down all basic programs, tools, configs, etc to configure as it should be actually.

## ‚õè Install

- `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:hamsternik/dotfiles.git` ‚Äì first "raw" setup
- `git submodule update --init --recursive` ‚Äì already downloaded repo w/o initialized submodules

## üóø Deploy

- open the Terminal.app (as I am preferred [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) but for the right start it's enough)
- generate new ssh key, details [on the GitHub doc](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "hamsternik9@gmail.com"`
- use the name `github-hamsternik` for public / private key
- start the ssh-agent in the background
- `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
- add the ssh private key to the ssh-agent
- `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/github-hamsternik`
- copy paste `ssh/config` on the local machine by the pass `~/.ssh/config`
- go into your [account settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) to add your public key
- `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/github-hamsternik.pub`
- download the `dotfiles` repository on your machine, clone the repo (see [Install](#-install) section)
- cd into the local repo
- install Homebrew and all my daily tools within üçª
- `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
- `make brew-install`
- next install `antibody` for the `zsh`
- `make antibody`
- last step is to install all configs in my user's root directory
- `make dotfiles-install`
- create `~/.zsh` and `~/.vim/bundle` directories manually (will automate due the [#29](https://github.com/hamsternik/dotfiles/issues/29) and [#30](https://github.com/hamsternik/dotfiles/issues/30) issues)
- go to the `~/.zsh` dir and run `git clone git@github.com:hamsternik/zsh-git-prompt.git`
- `cd` into the `zsh-git-prompt` and run 2 commands ([read more details](https://github.com/hamsternik/zsh-git-prompt?organization=hamsternik&organization=hamsternik))
- `stack setup`
- `stack build && stack install`
- go to the `~/.vim/bundle` and run `git clone git@github.com:VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git`
- open vim and use `PluginInstall` command to install all the plugins

#### Troubleshooting

- error due terminal init `zsh compinit: insecure directories`

You can find the solution [here on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13762280/zsh-compinit-insecure-directories).

## üìë Zsh Configuration

[Antibody](https://getantibody.github.io) - my main shell plugin manager for all Zsh plugins.

**All Plugins**

- [zsh-git-prompt](https://github.com/olivierverdier/zsh-git-prompt) - Informative git prompt for zsh.
- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) - Fish-like autosuggestions for zsh.
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) - Fish shell like syntax highlighting for Zsh.

### Antibody + Clean My Mac

My one and only OS is *macOS* and also I am the active user of the `CleanMyMac` app to eventually clean my disk from any sort of trash. But due to the cleaning CleanMyMac removes all antibody plugins cache üòû

After finishing basic `CleanMyMac` clean up it is a good time to re-install all Zsh plugins.

Run `make antibody` command in the root directory. Another option: open `~/dotfiles/antibody` directory and manually run `install.sh`.

## üëÄ Miscellaneous

### Fonts

I'm using `spaceship-prompt` as a default Zsh prompt after a long time trying to customize it on my own. It required `zsh` to be installed and [Powerline Font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) as well.

#### Deploy

- download the [repo](https://github.com/hamsternik/dotfiles/tree/master/fonts)
- cd to the `fonts` directory
- copy fonts to the `~/Library/Fonts` directory

### True Color Supporting

I switched from the default Terminal.app macOS application to the [cross-platform, GPU-accelerated and popular terminal emulator](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty). Say hello, alacritty üëãüèª

The topmost reason of doing that is that [the Terminal.app does not support true colors](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728#not-supporting-true-color) and I **basically can not** make my vim so much brilliant as I can do, obviously.

Right now I am using [onedark](https://github.com/joshdick/onedark.vim) colorscheme paired with the [lightline](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) which [is veeery sweety](https://www.sainnhe.dev/post/status-line-config/) yeah!

### MongoDB

Basically, I am not a cloud engineer, so I really need some space to recall the basic information about i.e. how to run
a mongoDB service localy. Here it is!

- to run MongoDB process

```
brew services start mongodb-community
```

- to stop MongoDB as macOS service
```
brew services stop mongodb-community
```

More info how to install and work with the latest version of MongoDB Community take a look in the [documentation page](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#run-mongodb-community-edition).

### SourceKit-LSP ‚ù§Ô∏è VSCode

The SourceKit-LSP server is included with the Swift toolchain. Currently my single workflow is using the latest Xcode app within macOS.
Starting from Xcode 11.4+ `sourcekit-lsp` is included as the part of Swift toolchain.

The extension stored in the repo, follow the `vscode/extensions` path and run

```sh
code --install-extension sourcekit-lsp-development.vsix
```

Launch the VSCode with any Xcode project to verify wether `sourcekit-lsp` works without errors.
Then open `Settings (cmd+,) -> Extensions -> SourceKit-LSP` and configure both the `Server Path` and `Toolchain Path`.
Example of predefined settings for the plugin in the `vscode/settings.json`.

Unfortunately, `sourcekit-lsp` does not support standard iOS projects, including these I'm working day-to-day on my work. The pipeline to tackle Swift project together with LSP is using Swift Package Manager to build the project. If you have such type of project, e.g. CLI application builded on Swift just run `swift build` in terminal / VSCode.

To know more about what's sourcekit-lsp and how it can be bind together with VSCode follow the [official README on sourcekit-lsp GitHub page](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp).

#### [OPTIONAL] How to build VSCode extension from scratch?

Download the [sourcekit-lsp repo](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp) first. As I'm have `sourcekit-lsp` already as the part of Xcode toolchain the only thing what I need to do is build sourcekit-lsp extension for VScode. In terminal go into `sourcekit-lsp/Editors/vscode` directory and run the following commands to build the VSCode extension.

```sh
$ cd Editors/vscode
$ npm install
$ npm run dev-package
```

Install the package from the command-line

```sh
code --install-extension sourcekit-lsp-development.vsix
```
